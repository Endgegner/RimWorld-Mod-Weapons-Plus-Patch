#### SteamWorkshop

Update: Weapons+ creates better compatibility for other MeleeWeapon mods like DGWP* or WT* now.

Compatibility Changes: Removes the same weapons 'Scythe' of Dead Goat's Weapon Pack* and 'Katana' of Weapon Tech*, when found.
Beware: This will remove both weapons from the game entirely, since they would exist twice. Add Weapons+ only if you don't care about your old Katanas and Scythes on your savegames with DGWP or WT installed.
