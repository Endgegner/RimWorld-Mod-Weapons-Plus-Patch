#### SteamWorkshop

Update: Weapons+ creates better compatibility for other MeleeWeapon Mods like DGWP or WT now

Compatibility Changes
Removes the same weapons: 'Scythe' of Dead Goat's Weapon Pack or 'Katana' of Weapon Tech, when installed.
Beware: This will remove the Weapons from the game since they would exist twice. Only add Weapons+ if you don't care about your old Katanas and Scythes on your savegame.
